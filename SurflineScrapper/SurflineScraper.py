"""Simple class to read surfline data and return as a dataframe:

While the swell data is available on an hourly basis, this code simply returns
the min, max, and average waves over four 6 hour periods of the day

The data itself isn't stored on the Surfline website.  When the website is
loaded, a call to an external API is made. This class reads the external page.

This includes data that is behind the Surfline paywall.

Currently there's no functionality to change the number of datapoints returned
or other options. However if you modify the URL link, this is fairly easy.
